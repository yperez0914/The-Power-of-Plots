The task at hand:
Given the results of a study on mice treated with a variety of drug regimens, I have generated tables and figures for the technical report of the study. 249 mice underwent treatment over the course of 45 days. Their tumor volumes were recorded throughout the duration of the study. Please see "Analysis" for the full tables and figures generated.
